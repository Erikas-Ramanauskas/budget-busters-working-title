## Project Development and Planning 

### Project Goals 

#### Project Purpose

This game was planned and developed using principles of User Experience (UX) design, which include the five planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface. Using these principles, the aim was to create a fun, easy-to-use, responsive, and engaging game that entertains users who are interested in learning more about financial concepts. 

#### Client Goals

Our website was built as a part of the January 2024 Budget-Buster-themed hackathon with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). It is an interactive game designed to entertain users of all ages and backgrounds who want to learn more about financial planning, particularly those interested in investing, passive income and budgeting. Despite this being built for a hackathon, it was still treated as a real-world application for potential clients interested in learning about how to financially plan in a fun, engaging way. Thus, this client's goals would be:

- Engaging the users with interactive, fun prompts, such as life happenings, deals and expenses
- Helping users learn more about how to spend or save their money
- Entertaining users by giving them different financial scenarios and choices of how to manage them
- Ensuring the questions and options are clear, and the game is simple to navigate

#### Target Audience

- This quiz is designed for users of any background or age, but will most likely gain more interest from those interested in budgeting, saving and investing
- It is also likely to draw in users who want to play around with different incomes and learn how to generate passive income 
- The simplicity of the game makes it easy for adults, teenagers and even children to take, and retake, the game as many times as they want, until they win

### Research 

#### Key Takeaways

We reviewed other websites and games to get an idea of how we should implement our design and functionality. These are our key takeaways:

- The website should be eye-catching, to make users excited about playing the game
- The Website should be clean, simple, and easy to navigate
- The game should be fun and easy to navigate through
- The game should be challenging but not too difficult 
- The user should feel as if they are winning, but not too easily

### User Stories

In a real-world application, this kind of quiz will mostly likely be used by a visitor once, rather than repeatedly, as it would likely form part of a larger website e.g. a website about personality types and research. Therefore, all user stories relate to a first-time user. As a first-time user, I would like to:

- take part in a fun, interesting game and learn more about financial planning
